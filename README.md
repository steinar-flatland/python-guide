# python-guide

[A Brief Introduction To Python](./A-Brief-Introduction-To-Python.md) is a concise introduction to the Python programming language, designed for experienced programmers who are relatively new to Python.

My name is Steinar Flatland. I am an experienced software engineer and architect. Over the years, I have worked with many programming languages, including FORTRAN, Pascal, C, C++, Java, and C#, among others.

At the time I wrote this guide, I had only used Python casually for occasional scripting and was beginning to get involved in AI enablement efforts. Since many AI orchestration frameworks are written primarily in Python, I was motivated to deepen my understanding of the language. This guide captures the foundational knowledge I sought out and internalized early in that process — with a focus on writing clean, idiomatic Python.

What began as personal notes grew into something more structured, and I decided to publish it in case it might be helpful to others on a similar journey.
