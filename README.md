# python-guide

[A Brief Introduction To Python](./A-Brief-Introduction-To-Python.md) is a quick introduction to the Python programming language for experienced programmers who are relatively new to Python.

My name is Steinar Flatland.  I am an experienced software engineer and architect.  Over the years, I have worked with many programming languages, including FORTRAN, Pascal, C, C++, Java, and C#, among others.  At the time I wrote this guide, I had only used Python casually for occasional scripting, and I was starting to get involved in AI enablement efforts.  The fact that AI orchestration frameworks tend to be written primarily in Python motivated me to learn more about the Python language.  This guide represents the knowledge I sought out and internalized early in my Python journey, to help me get started writing idiomatic code.  At first, I wrote these notes just for myself, and I decided to publish them in case they could be helpful for others.
